ChromaDoze creates an infinite stream of custom-colored noise. Simply draw the sound you want to hear.

It is intended to be used as a sleep sound generator.  It provides rapid feedback to adjustments in the spectrum, and is designed to minimize CPU usage in the steady state.

It works by running shaped white noise through an Inverse Discrete Cosine Transform, generating a few megabytes of distinct audio blocks.  The steady-state behavior selects blocks at random, and smoothly crossfades between them.

Made in 2010 and it still works! You wouldn't believe how often Android deprecates stuff.
